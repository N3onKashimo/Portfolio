In theatre, you don’t usually think about graphics cards. You think about
    lights, sets, sound cues, and maybe the projector that always seems to die
    five minutes before rehearsal. But during a projection festival, I found
    myself upgrading a dusty desktop GPU — and realizing this was more than just
    about hardware. It was about seeing IT as part of the stage.
</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-tmuh7fos>From Projection to Problem-Solving</h2> <p data-astro-cid-tmuh7fos>
The festival relied heavily on projection mapping, and the old desktop just
    couldn’t keep up. Animations lagged, software stuttered, and rendering took
    forever. The fix was a straightforward GPU swap, but the process wasn’t just
    “plug and play.” It meant troubleshooting drivers, checking power supply
    limits, and making sure the software recognized the new card before showtime.
</p> <blockquote data-astro-cid-tmuh7fos>
“Theatre teaches you timing. IT teaches you resilience. Together, they teach
    you how to solve problems when the curtain is about to rise.”
</blockquote> <h2 data-astro-cid-tmuh7fos>Learning Systems Thinking</h2> <p data-astro-cid-tmuh7fos>
That GPU upgrade wasn’t just about graphics — it was about thinking in
    systems. Projection needed stable hardware, but also proper ventilation,
    updated drivers, and contingency planning if things failed mid-show. It was
    the first time I connected the dots: IT inside theatre wasn’t separate from
    the art. It was part of the infrastructure, like lighting rigs or stage
    management.
</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-tmuh7fos>Beyond the Desktop</h2> <p data-astro-cid-tmuh7fos>
Looking back, that moment kick-started a bigger shift in how I approached
    technology. Fixing a machine was one thing, but designing systems that
    supported people — directors, designers, performers — was another. It was a
    step toward systems thinking: asking how each piece of tech fits into the
    larger production, and how to build solutions that are reliable under
    pressure.
</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-tmuh7fos>Takeaway</h2> <p data-astro-cid-tmuh7fos>
What started as a GPU upgrade became a lesson in IT inside a live
    performance environment. Hardware matters, but context matters more.
    Supporting creativity with technology is about solving problems before they
    become show-stoppers. That’s systems thinking — and it all started with one
    old desktop in a projection booth.
