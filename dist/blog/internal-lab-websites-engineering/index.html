When I joined as a Continuous Improvement Technician, one of the first big
    projects handed to me was migrating critical ISO 17025 processes — corrective
    actions, risk management, and customer complaints — off shared documents and
    into an internal lab website. The goal wasn’t just “go digital.” It was about
    building something engineers would actually use day to day instead of
    forgetting in a folder somewhere.
</p> <h2>Corrective Actions</h2> <p>
Corrective actions are the bread and butter of compliance. Anytime an audit
    revealed an issue, or a process slipped, we had to track the problem, the
    fix, and the verification. In shared docs, this was messy — multiple versions,
    no clear status, and no accountability.
</p> <p>
The website version gave us a cleaner flow: open corrective actions, assigned
    owners, deadlines, and progress tracking that didn’t get buried. It made the
    difference between “something we react to once a year” and “a living system
    that keeps us accountable.”
</p> <h2>Risk Management</h2> <p>
Risk management had the same issue — lots of notes floating around, but no
    central way to prioritize. My job was to help create a page that allowed
    engineers to log risks, assign severity scores, and record mitigations in a
    structured way.
</p> <p>
Moving this into the site meant people could actually see the bigger picture:
    what risks were open, what was under control, and what needed immediate
    attention. That visibility made risk less abstract and more like an active
    checklist.
</p> <h2>Customer Complaints</h2> <p>
Customer complaints had to be handled carefully. Every single one needed a
    record: what the issue was, who reported it, what action was taken, and how
    it was resolved. Before, this lived in shared spreadsheets that got cluttered
    fast. By porting it into the internal website, we created a cleaner, traceable
    log that not only helped compliance but also gave managers a snapshot of
    trends.
</p> <blockquote>
“Taking these processes out of scattered spreadsheets and putting them into
    a site turned them from static records into tools the team could actually
    work with.”
</blockquote> <h2>UI/UX with Engineers (and Excel?)</h2> <p>
At first, I approached this like any design project — I used Figma to sketch
    out how the pages might look and flow. Buttons, fields, and layouts felt more
    natural to test visually. But then I was advised to move everything into
    Excel for mockups. At first, it felt backwards — who uses Excel as a UX tool?
</p> <p>
But in this environment, Excel made sense. It was familiar, easy to share,
    and didn’t require engineers to learn a new design platform just to give
    feedback. Using Excel as a pseudo-wireframing tool wasn’t conventional, but
    it fit the workflow the team already trusted. And in the end, adoption
    mattered more than “best practices.”
</p> <h2>What I Learned</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Compliance tools need buy-in:</strong> If people won’t use it,
      it doesn’t matter how polished it looks.
</li> <li> <strong>UI/UX is relative:</strong> In some environments, Excel can be a
      design tool if it gets the job done.
</li> <li> <strong>Porting isn’t just copying:</strong> Moving from shared docs to
      a site means rethinking how information flows, not just where it lives.
</li> </ul> <h2>Looking Back</h2> <p>
The project showed me that building internal tools is less about perfect
    design and more about practical adoption. Engineers didn’t need Figma
    prototypes — they needed clear, usable pages that fit into their workflow.
    By the end, the corrective action, risk management, and complaint pages
    weren’t just compliance checkboxes — they were live tools that made our lab
    more accountable and audit-ready.
</p> <p>
It was a reminder that IT and process improvement overlap in unexpected ways
    — sometimes the most “technical” part of the job is making sure people
    actually want to use what you build.
