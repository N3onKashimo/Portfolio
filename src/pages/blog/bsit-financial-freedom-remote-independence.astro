  <h2>🎓 Why I Chose a BS in Information Technology to Reach Financial Freedom and Remote Independence</h2>

  <p><strong>By: Idi Ooko</strong><br />
  Aspiring DevOps Engineer | Rogue AI Architect | Frugal Systems Builder</p>

  <h2>🌍 From Hustles to Strategy: Why IT?</h2>
  <p>
    The exact moment I realized side hustles alone weren’t enough came when I found myself 
    completely drained — trying to juggle extra responsibilities at work, keep up with 
    trading and flipping loops, and stay socially active. On top of that, I wasn’t being 
    selected for IT roles inside my own company, and my living situation left me 
    uncomfortable and far from family. It was a low point: too much energy spent on hustling, 
    and not enough on building something lasting.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s when it clicked — I didn’t just need “more work,” I needed leverage. And for me, 
    that meant pivoting into IT, where skills, systems, and strategy compound over time.
  </p>

  <h2>🧠 Why WGU’s BSIT?</h2>
  <p>
    Choosing Western Governors University was simple: I didn’t have to start over. My 
    Associate’s in Theatre transferred in, letting me immediately begin a bachelor’s program 
    without piling on extra prerequisites. On top of that, WGU isn’t just a degree — it 
    builds certifications directly into the coursework. That means I’m not stuck paying 
    for a degree <em>and</em> then shelling out again for certifications. Each step is 
    verifiable progress.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accelerated + Competency-Based:</strong> I can move as fast as I can prove my knowledge.</li>
    <li><strong>Stackable Credentials:</strong> Security+, Network+, AWS Cloud Practitioner, and more — all built into the degree.</li>
    <li><strong>Aligned With My Projects:</strong> My Rogue AI Second Brain and homelab server become part of my learning, not distractions from it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💻 Projects That Keep Me Learning</h2>
  <p>
    The proudest projects I’ve built so far are my <strong>AI Second Brain dashboard</strong> 
    — a local Streamlit + Python system that helps me track memory, tasks, and Security+ prep — 
    and my <strong>CasaOS-powered homelab server</strong>, which hosts my personal media and 
    forces me to get hands-on with Linux every day. These aren’t just side experiments; they 
    double as living labs where I test the same skills I’ll use in IT roles.
  </p>

  <h2>💼 How It Aligns with Remote Work and Earning Goals</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><td>💻 Remote Work</td><td>Security+, AWS, and DevOps skills open doors to remote-compatible roles, especially if I pursue DoD clearance.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>💰 Financial Freedom</td><td>Higher IT salaries + my frugal systems let me stack savings and invest faster.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>🛠 Home Server Projects</td><td>Linux, Docker, and VPN practice that counts toward both school and resume.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>📅 Flexible Schedule</td><td>WGU’s pace-based model means I can study around my full-time job.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>🧑‍💻 DevOps Portfolio</td><td>My AI dashboard, Notion syncs, and automation projects show employers real skills in action.</td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>🧭 My 5-Year Mission Plan</h2>
  <p>
    I treat life like an RPG with tracked phases. My degree is one questline in a larger roadmap:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Year 1–2:</strong> Earn Security+, finish BSIT, and land my first remote IT role.</li>
    <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> Start MSIT while stacking AWS, Linux+, and CI/CD knowledge.</li>
    <li><strong>Year 4:</strong> Blend remote tech income with creative work (modeling, AMVs, blog, embroidery).</li>
    <li><strong>Year 5:</strong> Work remotely from Mexico, Bali, and beyond — saving aggressively in strong-USD locations.</li>
    <li><strong>Year 6:</strong> Reach financial independence through maxed-out Roth IRA, 401k, and multiple income streams.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💡 What Financial Freedom Feels Like</h2>
  <p>
    For me, financial freedom isn’t about luxury. It’s the peace of being able to sit down 
    and eat without feeling stressed about every dollar. I’ve dealt with money trauma — 
    even when I had $5,000 saved, spending $5 could trigger panic. I want the comfort of 
    choice, without always sacrificing quality for survival. That’s the independence I’m 
    working toward.
  </p>

  <h2>✍️ Closing Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    I don’t have all the answers yet — IT is tough because so many entry-level jobs still 
    demand experience you can’t get without a job first. But what I do know is this: 
    <strong>if it’s the path you want, stay hungry</strong>. Share your progress, your 
    projects, your story. You never know who’s watching and willing to give you that 
    first shot — whether it’s an internship, a contract, or a job.
  </p>
  <p>
    This degree isn’t just a credential for me. It’s a lever. It bridges where I am now 
    to where I want to be — not just in income, but in freedom. And with every course, 
    every certification, and every system I build, I’m closer to living life completely 
    on my terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re like me — someone who learns by doing, thinks like a builder, and dreams of 
    owning your time — then this path might be for you too. Let’s build the life we 
    deserve. One credential, one project, one rogue system at a time.
