  <h2>Why I‚Äôm Building My Rogue AI Second Brain</h2>
  <p>
    I made this AI after watching a NetworkChuck video about building a local AI
    and thought ‚Äî why can‚Äôt I take this further and make it into a second brain
    for myself? My goal wasn‚Äôt just to run AI locally, but to have it pull my
    tasks, keep me accountable, and prevent me from falling into the feedback
    loop of second-guessing myself with ChatGPT.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don‚Äôt believe in paying higher prices just because of inflation when most
    of this can be built with free, open tools. For me, the best way to truly
    own my privacy and data was to build the concept myself ‚Äî and while doing so,
    I‚Äôd also get hands-on experience with <strong>Python</strong>, 
    <strong>Streamlit</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong> workflows, and 
    <strong>Security+</strong> study material. Each phase has become a way to
    measure and benchmark my growing toolkit.
  </p>

  <h2>My Roadmap So Far</h2>
  <p>
    To stay focused, I broke the project into phases. Each step adds a layer of
    capability to the dashboard while keeping everything local.
  </p>

  <h3>‚úÖ Finished</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Vector Memory (Chat Log Recall) ‚Äì completed July 13, 2025. The system now recalls past notes and documents on demand.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Calendar Integration (Google Calendar) ‚Äì currently syncing when I open the Memory Search tab.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Notion To-Do Integration ‚Äì pulls in my Notion tasks so I can see tasks and events in one place.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üîÑ In Progress</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phase 1a:</strong> Zep + AutoGen Agent ‚Äì adding human-like memory recall on top of my vector memory.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>‚è≥ Next Up</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Energy-Level Logic ‚Äì connect Apple Health, Google Fit, and weather data to adapt tasks based on my energy and environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> Unified Prompt Chain ‚Äì merge memory, personas, and energy awareness into one workflow.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 6:</strong> Docker + GitHub Actions ‚Äì containerize the system and automate deployment with DevOps tooling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Plans</h2>
  <p>
    Once the basics are solid, I want to ‚ÄúDevOpsify‚Äù this project ‚Äî containerize
    it, version control it properly, and maybe even make parts of it shareable
    without giving away personal data. I also see opportunities to link what
    I‚Äôm learning for <strong>Security+</strong> into the build itself ‚Äî things
    like access control, logging, and identity management.
  </p>

  <h2>Takeaway</h2>
  <p>
    This project isn‚Äôt just about passing Security+ or replacing ChatGPT ‚Äî it‚Äôs
    about proving that <strong>anything can be built locally if you‚Äôre willing
    to put in the time</strong>. You don‚Äôt need enterprise budgets or endless
    subscriptions. And if you fall on your face along the way? That‚Äôs part of
    the process. Every mistake is just another layer of learning in the second
    brain I‚Äôm building for myself.
