  <h2>Starting Early</h2>
  <p>
    My first experiments with tech didn’t start in a lab or a classroom — they
    started in 3rd grade with a Nintendo Wii. I wanted free games, Brawl hacks,
    and custom music swaps. Project M was all the hype, and in Video Game Club
    we’d play it like it was official. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem? I couldn’t get it to work. I tried in 3rd grade, failed. Tried
    again in 5th grade, failed again. Every guide looked simple until I was the
    one holding the SD card. Still, I kept coming back. I didn’t know it yet,
    but that persistence was my first real tech skill.
  </p>

  <h2>The Summer of 8th Grade</h2>
  <p>
    One summer in 8th grade, it finally clicked. I figured out the file
    structure, loaded the Homebrew Channel, and actually got Brawl mods running.
    Suddenly we had Project M, custom music, and a Wii that felt brand new. 
  </p>

  <p>
    That same summer I discovered emulators. I didn’t have a PS3 or an Xbox One,
    so if I wanted to play the games everyone else talked about, I had to make
    do with what I had. My laptop became my “everything console” — downloading
    ROMs, tinkering with settings, and building the gaming library I never
    could’ve afforded otherwise.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The Wii wasn’t just a console. It was my first lab, my first playground,
    and my first taste of breaking and fixing tech.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>The Android Rooting Era</h2>
  <p>
    Around the same time, I started messing with Android phones. We didn’t buy
    the latest iPhones or flagships — we got prepaid unlocked phones, usually a
    generation or two behind. Out of the box, they felt stripped down compared
    to what everyone else had. Rooting wasn’t about flexing — it was about
    survival.
  </p>

  <p>
    I needed features my phone didn’t ship with: custom ROMs, better battery
    life, removing bloatware that slowed everything down. Every root was like a
    jailbreak out of necessity. Some nights it worked. Other nights I soft
    bricked the device and spent hours digging through XDA forums for a way
    back. But little by little, I learned how Android actually worked under the
    hood.
  </p>

  <h2>Making Do With What I Had</h2>
  <p>
    None of this looked like “IT training” at the time. It just looked like me
    refusing to accept limits. No new consoles? Emulate. No high-end phone?
    Root. No money for new games? Mod Brawl and play Project M with friends. 
  </p>

  <p>
    That mindset — stretch what you have, push it past the limits, and fix it
    when it breaks — is the same one I use now when I’m troubleshooting real IT
    problems.
  </p>

  <h2>What It Taught Me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Persistence:</strong> I failed more times than I succeeded at
      first, but every retry got me closer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Problem-solving:</strong> Bricked devices meant learning recovery
      tools and bootloader tricks I never thought I’d need.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resourcefulness:</strong> Free guides, sketchy downloads, late
      nights on forums — I learned how to find answers when nobody was holding
      my hand.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Looking Back</h2>
  <p>
    At the time, it was just me chasing free games, customizing phones, and
    making old hardware do more than it should. But those experiments taught me
    persistence, discipline, and curiosity — the core of every IT job I’ve ever
    had since. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn’t realize it then, but bricking Wiis, rooting budget Androids, and
    playing with emulators were my first steps into IT. I wasn’t following a
    career path — I was just making do. But that’s exactly how the career path
    started.
